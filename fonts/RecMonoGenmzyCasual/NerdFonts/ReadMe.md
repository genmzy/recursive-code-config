# Genmzy Made Custome Font
- This is perfect and most staitisfied fonts for me to code, but it still need to add nerd font icons.
- I add the nerd font icons to make the nerd font, and also, different OS platforms.
- In light mode, these fonts looks too thin, so I recommand using these fonts in dark background.
- This is most suitable for dark mode on the Windows Terminal with `"antialiasingMode": "grayscale"`.
- Good-looking on neovim `colorscheme gruvbox`
- Nerd font patches see [here](https://github.com/genmzy/nerd-fonts)
- Font path command is `/path/to/nerd-fonts/font-patcher -c ./RecMonoGenmzyCasual-Italic-1.079.ttf`, `-w` for generating windows compatible font.
